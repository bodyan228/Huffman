The Future of Technology
1.	Technology is a huge part of our lives and its usage will increase considerably more in the future. It evolves so fast and can change anything in the blink of an eye. Therefore, being informed about the aspects influenced by it and how we can adapt to the changes caused by the rapid development of technology, is quite important.
Executive Summary
2.	This article investigates the future of technology and its development. The rapid development of technology has a large impact not only in advanced fields, but also in our daily life. Thus, exploring concepts and utopian ideas that influences each and every life and viability is demanded.
3.	Scientists and innovators all over the world are making inquiries and taking actions in this field. High-tech companies such as Apple, Microsoft, and so on, together with their CEOs are big part of these advancements. Each plan of action of these companies can change many things due to the fact that they have massive enterprises and numerous advanced technologies with highly educated and open-minded staff.
4.	People like Elon Musk — the CEO and Founder of Tesla — have already started developing ideas and proceeding their steps towards the future. Therefore, this analysis of concepts leading to raising awareness as taking part in this huge evolution can affect many aspects of our lives, for better.
Introduction
5.	From millions of years ago, humans started to reflect and question disparate phenomena happening around them, try to find a logical reason for them and perceive an order between these phenomena. Hence, all these thinking and scientific steps to ascertain a logic has led our lives to where it is now and the discovery of technology.
6.	Technology is a huge part of our lives today. Numbers of electronic devices such as cellphones or laptops, advanced systems used for health care and medical purposes, the artificial intelligence utilized in security systems along with others, are just a few examples of technology and its wide usage in our daily lives. All these changes, that have happened to humans were so unexpected and hard to predict as technology evolves so fast and certainly the life that we are going to live in even within a decade will be entirely different than how it is now.
7.	The influence that technology has on our lives and also our future is exceedingly more than what we can think, which adapting to these changes can be tough for all of us in different ways. Although they can make our lives easier and upgrade our living standards, it is right to consider their disadvantages as well.
8.	These changes are due to rapid developments and critical thinking. Critical thinking has made all of us work together as one and try to make this world a better place. Our ideas and concepts in unison are for improvement and progress. As a result of all the efforts of human beings throughout history, technology was born. This mutation has changed many lives. Therefore, this decently rapid change, will be replacing an extensive variety of tools in our life. Its development is ceaseless and will continue from here to eternity. Nonetheless, we are just at the beginning.
9.	Accordingly, being informed about how it will affect our lives and how we can adapt to these changes is quite important. As most of us are visionary people, being aware of the future of technology, will help us to plan a better future for ourselves. This plan may include education, place of residence, applying for jobs, and so on, that assuredly technology will play a major role in. Analyzing those aspects of our lives that have been influenced by technology, can assist us in decision-making along with. The things that are going to happen in the future will completely alter one’s lifestyle.
10.	In this article, the future of technology will be analyzed and different concepts for future gadgets and electronic devices will be mentioned as well as a brief explanation for each one. This analysis can familiarize us all with the future ahead, how we can be a part of this change and as mentioned, help us in planning and decision-making.
Technology; The power of change
11.	Technology can change anything in our lives, from the smallest aspects to even changing the world. We are privileged to be living in a time where science and technology can assist us, make our lives easier and rethink the ways we go about our daily lives (Landrige and Willings, 2017, Section 1).
12.	Overall, most Americans anticipate that the technological developments of the coming half-century will have a net positive impact on society. Some 59% are optimistic that coming technological and scientific changes will make life in the future better, while 30% think these changes will lead to a future in which people are worse off than they are today usage (Smith, 2014, Paragraph 2).
13.	Plans of high-tech companies that are leaders of this industry, can mutate minor and major aspects of life in an alarming way. Every day without exception, news from these companies is being heard and their innovations are updating progressively. This list of current and future technologies certainly has the potential to change our lives even more (Landrige and Willings, 2017, Section 1).
14.	But as observed, this technology and the people behind it are in one way or another controlling our lives, involuntary. We may think the changes that are happening in our lives are out of our control, and we cannot be a part of it. Some of these can be difficult to deal with, or not in our favor. However, rather than just accept the idea that the effects of technology are beyond our control, we must recognize the powerful role it plays in our everyday lives and decide what we want to do about it (Stanford University, 2021, Paragraph 2).
15.	By understanding how these changes happen and what is the reason behind them, each and every person can take part in this advancement and try to plan a future that benefits all the people around the world. Technology is a source of power for mankind, and individuals should be aware of its influence and how it can be controlled, in order to use it for making a more productive life.
16.	Technology gives each person the ability to access different options simultaneously, and this ability should be used in wider ranges. Via apprehension of technology, this use can turn into an innovation and therefore, a change for the better.
Life-changing Technologies
17.	There may be ideas in our mind that we might think they are unachievable or beyond the reality. Shockingly, thanks to the existence of technology, these ideas may not be that far from us.
18.	As technology has already shown its massive effect on lives, it is not so hard to believe that these developments are going to continue forever, presumably.
19.	According to a survey done by Pew Research Center and Smithsonian Magazine, The American public anticipates that the coming half-century will be a period of profound scientific change, as inventions that were once confined to the realm of science fiction come into common usage (Smith, 2014, Paragraph 1).
20.	We are in the 21st century, and if we are being honest with ourselves, technology is incredibly advanced, and we are making strides that can push things even farther. We have cars that are much safer than they had been in the past decade, and we are even making fully electric cars that can help save the planet. There are even plans for self-driving cars and even self-driving Ubers that make the future of transportation very exciting (Insane Curiosity, 2020, 00:16).
21.	In this context, you will be exploring the future concepts for technology and gadgets:
Medical Devices
22.	Human errors have always occurred during operations and medical treatments, which some are irreparable. As a consequence, humans have been thinking of ways to reduce these errors. With that being the case, technology was the best answer to this problem. Ergo, different devices and advanced systems have entered the medical field.
23.	Next generation of medical devices are devices that actually use new technologies that are being developed in physics, engineering and chemistry that allow us a more exquisite control over the matter of the next generation of medical devices. Scientists strive to develop technologies or new devices that will solve current unmet clinical needs (Trinity College Dublin, 2014, 00:10).
24.	Smart, connected medical devices are now technologically and economically feasible. As health care shifts from institutional to outpatient and home settings, MedTech companies considers focusing on opportunities that will likely result in product and market share advantages in this new landscape. The next decade will likely be critical in linking data generated by these smart MedTech devices with data from traditional systems, and integrating that information into everyday practice. (Next generation “smart” MedTech devices, 2015, page 12).
25.	The table below provides examples of opportunities for MedTech companies to demonstrate value through next-generation of MedTech devices. Across episode types — from acute to chronic to preventive care — health systems and other purchasers are looking for solutions to help them achieve better results. (Next generation “smart” MedTech devices, 2015, Page 10).
Artificial Intelligence
26.	“Artificial Intelligence refers to machines doing intellectual tasks at a level comparable to humans — for example reasoning, planning, learning, and using natural language to communicate at a high level. Artificial intelligence also includes sensing and interacting with the physical world.” (Next generation “smart” MedTech devices, 2015, Page 8).
27.	Almost every technology that replaces human actions is Artificial Intelligence. Humans in order to make their lives easier, reduce human errors in vital actions, and so on, are using this technology — Artificial Intelligence — and its usage is increasing gradually.
28.	“AI is all around us. It is in machines, robots and even our smartphones. Voice assistants such as Siri, Alexa and Google Assistant prove how far AI has already come, but it could eventually find its way into things like robot servants” (Landrige and Willings, 2017, Section 25).
Transportation
29.	On the report of Futurology YouTube channel (2021), With not that being far from reality, electric cars will be replacing current cars in the future, which will be all autonomous. There will be no gas stations and instead, at-home charging stations with only 10 minutes of refilling will replace them. Most cars will be self-driving, allowing the driver to lay back and relax. The delivery system will be autonomous semi-tracks, robots and delivery drones.
30.	Roads will be in 3D shapes. Also, air taxis will be added, and passengers can easily travel through air. There will be gyroscopic buses, which will be passing over cars and making the trip faster for each passenger. Jets will be more seen as faster airplanes. The fuel of these airplanes will be replaced by hydrogen, and the fossil fuel will start to fade away. As for sea transportations, all boats will be electrical.
Future cities
31.	In this chapter, Insane Curiosity YouTube channel (2020) mentions Elon Musk’s perspective of a technology-based future city. According to Forbes, Elon Musk is the most innovative person in the world. Therefore, his picture for a future city is a city that includes advanced technologies. In this city, one of the major things to be noticed is the faster transportation ways both for people and delivery. One of the Elon Musk’s concepts for transportations is replacing airplanes with space rockets.
32.	Also, for in town transportations, he has introduced the idea of “using hyper loops.” All these ways of transportation are for people to travel easier, safer and faster.
33.	As the internet is a fundamental part of our lives, Elon Musk is planning to send the internet to even places where they do not have access to it, by Satellites. This project is a corporation of Elon Musk and Space X.
34.	In the schools of future cities, the subjects that will be taught are compatible with advanced technology of that time. Children will explore non-traditional topics such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), Robotics and Physics for instilling a problem-solving skill.
35.	Chips for brains are being made for future use of mankind that gives human brains superhuman powers of thinking and gaining information.
36.	Encyclopedically, technology is what future cities are made of and its development will be due to improving the current technologies and advancing it.
Concerns about the future of digital life
37.	Using technology has changed our lives so much that without it, we would not be able to live. But this huge change comes along with several concerns in different fields including health, justice and equality, security concerns and data leak, along with others.
38.	Without a doubt, there are many advantages of having technology in our lives. But instead of blindly celebrating or critiquing it, the scholars urge a debate about the unintended consequences and harmful impacts that can unfold from these powerful new tools and platforms (Stanford University, 2021, Section 2 — Paragraph 1).
39.	Scientific and technological advances offer incredible possibilities for increasing income and well-being, but they also imply enormous risks that run the gamut from burgeoning unemployment and inequality, or untenable pressures on social protection systems, to catastrophic threats to our planet or to human survival. This same technology offers new and better possibilities for dealing with these risks. Applying scientific and technological development to the effective improvement of living conditions for everyone, including sustainability, calls for updating the ethical schemes that help us to act in a responsible way in surroundings that are different from any we have ever known before and that continue to change at a very rapid rate. (Grey, D. A., & Rossiter, J., 2017, Page 5).
2 main concerns of people are:
40.	Inequality on the rise: The growing divide between haves and have-nots
41.	There are 5 main companies that are described as “Big Tech”; Google, Apple, Microsoft, Meta and Amazon. Their leaders and people at the same level of them use people of lower societies to test their plans and products on. It can be stated that social discrimination will be increasing with further developments of technology.
42.	The majority of respondents in a survey did by Pew Research Center, are in agreement that digital life is likely to improve the lives of people at the top of the socioeconomic ladder over the next few decades. A large share of those who predicted that internet use will produce change for the worse for most individuals over the next 50 years expressed concerns that an extension of current trends will lead to a widening economic divide that leaves the majority in the dust of the privileged class (Kathleen Stansberry, Janna Anderson, & Lee Rainie, 2019, Section 1 -Paragraph 2).
43.	A world in which AI becomes smarter than humans
44.	The Artificial Intelligence is a technology that is trying to be similar like human as much as possible. But the question is how far is this going to continue? It can be a concern for all of us due to the fact that someday, it is going to be the robots that will lead us and everything will be under their control, assumably. Companies such as Google have taken a step further in Artificial Intelligence researches and found a programming language that is unrecognizable for human. Reaching that point, they stopped the research. Is this a warning about the insanely fast development of technology? Shall we be worried?
45.	A share of respondents reflected on the potential dark side of recent innovations — a world in which neural implants help connect people’s brains to the internet — and shared concerns about the prospects of technology moving toward and beyond human-level artificial intelligence. (Kathleen Stansberry, Janna Anderson, & Lee Rainie, 2019, Section 3 -Paragraph 1).
Conclusion
46.	This research suggests that our lives is far more influenced by technology than what we used to think. In almost every field of living, the control that technology has over them as well as its effects are being observed. Its rapid development and changing every second in some ways make it hard for us to be updated and follow the right path. However, by doing the analysis and trying to follow a technology-based plan along with considering the disadvantages and problems that we are going to face, we can take part in this change and play a beneficial role for all mankind.
