1)This week’s Lenovo Tech World 2021 offered up one of the more exciting product announcements of late: the Lenovo ThinkReality A3 Smart Glasses. Though they had been previewed earlier this year at CES, this was their more formal coming-out party. 
2)The Lenovo smart glasses are available in parts of North America, Europe, and Asia, according to the company, with the ThinkReality A3 PC Edition priced at $1,499. The Industrial Edition, which is sold to enterprises, is available in a variety of bundles that include the A3 glasses. Pricing for the Industrial Edition is available here.
What's holding smart glasses back?
3)There are three limiting factors to making PCs wearable and far smaller than today’s laptops: the keyboard, mouse, and display. All set a laptop’s smallest reasonable size at about 12 inches diagonally.  Sure, you can make them smaller, but the market hasn’t exactly welcomed smaller laptops well. (HP had a very small designer line that looked good but didn’t sell well, and Sony, before it exited the market, tried several that also failed to gain traction.)
4)It is interesting to note that the first time I tried on a set of smart glasses was in the early part of the century; they came from Sony, cost a whopping $21,000 and were designed for use by surgeons in the operating room. I took the glasses to a LAN Party (where people connect computers to play eSports), and they were a big hit because they worked as well as a monitor and were a lot easier to transport. But the price tag was too rich for gamers, plus you couldn’t see your hands — making it easy to mess up your finger placement on the keyboard. 
5)While the ThinkReality A3 Smart Glasses are designed to improve remote collaboration, their ability to hook into a smartphone makes them an ideal testing platform for Microsoft Windows 365 on a mobile device. You can expand your view into something that could exceed your office monitor setup (since they can show up to five virtual monitors). 
Moving toward portability
6)The ThinkReality Smart Gasses weigh three-tenths of a pound, use Qualcomm’s XR-1 SmartViewer and have a resolution of 1080p per eye; compared to most laptops, they fall short of the 4K resolution that would be optimal.  They also have built-in speakers and three noise-suppressing microphones, making them ideal for those wanting to use voice as an interface or who are attending a Microsoft Teams, Zoom, or Cisco Webex conference remotely.

7)As I found during my Sony test, these glasses prevent others from seeing what is on your screen and, particularly in a plane, can be handy for both work and entertainment. You can look down while wearing them to see your hands if you are using a laptop. Still, you could swap that laptop to just a keyboard and touchpad if you wanted or use your smartphone (currently, they work with the Motorola G100 smartphone) with a portable keyboard and mouse. 
8)These glasses offer an exciting set of software features. They include voice recognition so they “know” you are you; have object and image recognition (using a built-in 8MP camera) so they can be informative about what you are seeing in the context to your surroundings; use head and gaze tracking to determine where you are looking; and include HDCP so you can watch movies legally. They even have a bar code reader so you can use them for inventories or authentication and can accept prescription lenses so you can customize them for your vision.
The next PC evolution?
9)I think we are slowly but surely creeping up on replacing PCs — at least notebook PCs — with something far smaller and wearable. To make them successful, we need decent head-mounted displays and products like Windows 365 that operate in the cloud.  While I’d like to see higher resolutions at least 2K, 1080p is a decent start for this initial offering — especially for those who genuinely need a more portable option. They could be particularly useful for those who do videoconferencing on the road. 
10)At this point, I see these ThinkReality A3 Smart Glasses as a bridge to our computing future, one that may not have a PC in it at all, replacing today’s hardware with a Smartphone tied to a cloud service instead. 
2)https://www.computerworld.com/article/3631377/8-surprising-ways-remote-work-helps-business.html
11)The rise of remote work is arguably the biggest change in how we work since the introduction of the networked PC. Yet so many unknowns remain.
12)When will pandemic-mandated remote work end? We don’t know.
13)What percentage of those now working from home will return to office work? We don’t know.
14)Is remote work, on balance, good for business? Or bad? Nobody agrees.
15)But we have learned a great many things about not only remote work, but office work, too — and the whole way business has been conducted in the past few decades. Because of what we’ve learned, business will function far better in the future.
16)Here are the eight ways remote work improved business by teaching us how to work together better:
1. Team, project and task management tools are better than MBWA
17)It’s astonishing that in the 21st Century, most managers, department heads, team leaders, and project leaders still practice MBWA (management by wandering around) — gauging employee productivity by, in part, looking at people to see if they appear to be working.

18)Just one problem: With knowledge work, anyone sitting at a computer appears to be working, even if they’re shopping on Amazon or posting cat photos on Facebook. Anyone staring out the window appears to be slacking off, even if they’re deep in thought coming up with the next million-dollar idea for your company.
19)Some companies are experimenting with new MBWA technology from companies like iMonitorSoft and EfficientLab — using cameras, keystroke loggers and software that captures desktop screens to make sure people are focused on tasks. This is no recipe for retaining top talent in most cases. People don’t want their companies surveilling their homes and families, and many feel strongly enough about it to seek employment elsewhere. And remote worker surveillance tools are easily defeated.
20)The post-pandemic intuition is correct: It’s better to focus on work delivered rather than observational guessing. Products like Asana, Basecamp, Trello, Jira, Podio, Taskworld, Monday.com and others combine team and individual task monitoring focused on time to completion, rather than “are they typing a lot.”
2. Zero trust is indispensable for security
21)The unplanned rush to remote work at the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic last year radically expanded the attack surface for organizations worldwide. Specifically, home offices tend to involve many applications on many devices used by many users (family members and guests) all accessing the same network, sometimes sharing devices.
22)The zero-trust security model is a conspicuously good idea under these circumstances. (Zero trust is an architecture in which every device, application and user must be individually verified and authorized based on the resource being accessed.)
23)What's also true is that zero trust is necessary now in offices, even those with strong perimeter defenses and good physical security. It took widespread remote work to make that clear.
3. Living in an expensive city to gain access to a high-paying job is wasteful
24)One reason knowledge workers move to big cities is that, historically, that’s where the high-paying jobs are. And the cost of living is much higher on average in cities with high-paying jobs. This is especially acute in Silicon Valley, where a family earning 200k lives a middle-class lifestyle because their ordinary tract  house costs $1.2 million and food, gas, clothes, insurance, and all the rest cost more than they do out in the country.
25)What makes more sense for everybody is for employees to live wherever they want, and for companies to pay less.
26)It’s a point of controversy, because some commentators say workers shouldn’t be “penalized” for remote work. And that’s true if remote work is part time and employees still need to be within driving distance of headquarters. But if people can live anywhere — in the suburbs, in small rural towns, in remote forests or, say, Costa Rica — and still do their jobs, the wasteful chain of events where employees live expensively so they can afford higher salaries that are necessary because they live expensively, etc., can be broken at long last.
4. Remote work communication tools are better for office work, too
27)We realized during the pandemic that basing all meetings on in-person gatherings wasn’t really ideal. Many of those meetings advantaged those in the room, with anyone on the speakerphone treated like a second class citizen, an afterthought, or a burden to the meeting.
28)Video meetings using Zoom, Microsoft Teams, Slack, BigBlueButton, BlueJeans, Whereby, GoToMeeting, Cisco WebEx, Google Meet, and others put everyone on an equal footing in terms of both participation and when sharing slides, documents, charts and other content.
5. Remote work is greener than office work
29)A new study by Alliance Virtual Offices found that, on average, each employee reduces their annual carbon footprint by roughly 1,800 pounds by working from home. Multiplied by the number of remote employees, allowing remote work is one of the most powerful ways for companies to contribute to the reduction in greenhouse gasses.
6. Office work is inefficient.
30)The Wall Street Journal recently reported that some remote workers took advantage of the situation by getting a second remote job, working two jobs with each employer believing they were working only one. (The “situation” I’m referring to is the existence of remote work without the performance management systems necessary to assure productivity.) “Many say they don’t work more than 40 hours a week for both jobs combined,” the article said.
31)To the extent that this is true and widespread enough to qualify as a trend, it reveals gross inefficiencies in how work is managed and measured. It also reminds us how much non-productive time is spent by employees getting ready for work and commuting each way. The Alliance Virtual Offices study found that employees in New York gained back 15.2% of their time by not commuting.
7. Most business travel is needless and expensive
32)With the lockdown remote work phenomenon, business travel took a hit. Organizations around the world realized that major savings could be realized when most business travel is replaced by Zoom calls and other internet-facilitated interactions.
33)While the big reduction in business travel from the pandemic isn’t directly associated with remote work after the pandemic, it’s the tools that became mainstream — especially the newfound usefulness and habit of video meetings — that have proved they can replace at least some business travel.
8. Hybrid work is better than either remote work or office work.
34)The truth is that some people have personalities or work styles that favor in-person collaboration. Other personalities crave the control and isolation of remote work. Each type thrives in one scenario more than the other.
35)The opportunity here is for hybrid work environments, where the extroverts can gather in the office and the introverts can work remotely.
36)All can use the new range of remote work tools. Right-sizing work location optimizes performance, improves staff retention and happiness and improves the competitiveness of the organization.
37)The bottom line is that we don't know exactly how remote work trends will ultimately pan out. But we do know that the knowledge we've gained by rushing to remote work will dramatically improve how business is done in the future.
3) https://www.computerworld.com/article/3632857/facebook-smart-glasses-and-some-lessons-for-apple.html
38)On the road to AR, Facebook snagged some attention this week with the arrival of its first smart glasses. As Apple inches toward the introduction of its own augmented spectacles, are there lessons here about what these things do and how they should work?
What Facebook's glasses do
39)First, let’s take a glance at Facebook’s smart glasses. They offer a pair of cameras to take photos and videos, boast a microphone and a speaker, and are controlled using a voice assistant.
40)Most observers describe these things as similar to Snapchat spectacles. Facebook has called them Stories, so now you know what the Story feature in Facebook most of us never use is for. The glasses are manufactured with Ray-Ban and look like Wayfarers. They cost $299 and Facebook says it wants them to “create a sense of social presence."
41)They aren’t AR glasses. Instead, they will let you film everything that happens around you, presumably so Facebook can analyze your habits and pump you up with advertising, which appears to be the social media company’s basic business plan.
42)The glasses look cool, the touch controls seem cool, but all you’re getting really is music on the move, a voice assistant that also takes calls, and the chance to take photos/videos on demand. These are accessories at best and are designed to work with an app on a smartphone. These smart glasses seem a little dumb.
43)What can Apple learn from all this? Here’s a few suggestions.
Price
44)I doubt Apple’s glasses will cost $299. They will network with an iPhone to deliver a range of high-end tools and will be supported by a set of app development tools designed to support what we already know are the key markets for AR: Location-based games such as Pokémon; enterprise and medical use; and access on-the-go to ambulatory information and entertainment. I’ve come across recent claims Apple’s first-generation glasses won’t support AR. I suspect an on-lens information system remains plausible.
45)Facebook’s offering is just a data-capture device with a voice assistant. Apple will offer more, and probably charge more, too.
Privacy
46)If you wear Facebook glasses, don’t be surprised to find yourself asked to leave them at the box office when you attend a live performance, take part in a meeting, visit court, or even wander around some shopping malls. As word spreads, it will become a social faux-pas to wear them at social gatherings. People don’t trust Facebook on privacy.
47)What Apple learns: We know Apple supports privacy (or used to). When it chooses to introduce its own glasses, it will need to create location-based technologies through integration with Maps that enable destinations to prevent filming from taking place.
48)It also seems likely an activity light will demonstrate when filming/recording is taking place. Privacy advocates will demand the latter, while certain locations will require the former.
The potential
49)There doesn’t yet appear to be a developer environment around Facebook’s glasses. That’s going to limit what they can do. Apple knows that to create compelling experiences for a vast audience, it must enable a developer ecosystem. This is the approach it takes across all its products, bar some accessories.
50)Apple’s glasses focus is likely to evolve around augmented reality experiences and information access, such as guides to shopping malls, tourist guides, or even overlaid information to guide medical procedures. (Arguably, medical and some industrial deployments became the key success stories around Google Glass.)
51)Apple’s work in Arcade means it also has the potential to create its own interactive gaming experiences to support the products it eventually ships. Plus, why not sit back and watch Apple Music or TV+ videos on your glasses when you travel?
Strategy
52)Ultimately, Facebook’s strategy seems flawed by lack of preparation. It is only now investing in processor technologies to support its efforts. It has Oculus technologies, but these seem to be on a different tack, focused on pure AR experiences. Integration with the smartphone seems quite limited, Facebook has failed to build a solid reputation around privacy and doesn’t (yet) appear to have built much in the way of a supporting development environment. To be fair, beyond Oculus, Facebook does have several assets it could leverage; I have no doubt it is already iterating more sophisticated glasses in its labs.
53)Apple, meanwhile, already seems to be working on how to develop health sensors for its future wearables. It is fair to note that most market speculation at present sees Apple introduce a less well-featured first iteration of its glasses next year, before a more sophisticated solution ships a few years down the line.
54)What it calls to mind
Facebook’s new offering calls to mind Samsung’s early move to rush the introduction of its own smart watch before Apple basically defined the category with Apple Watch. Samsung won a lot of support for its move at that time, but Apple blew it out the water when it followed suit.
55)Samsung’s Galaxy Watch still has its advocates, (not least because some models are round, which so many people prefer), but while Apple Watch holds about 28% of the market, Samsung has just 7.6%, according to Counterpoint.
56)It’s an open question the extent to which Facebook will be able to leverage its stained brand to grab market share in the emerging smart glasses market as Apple and others bring the products they have been developing to market in the next year or so.
57)Facebook’s push seems unlikely to dent the universe, but certainly shows the growing competition between both companies as the battle for the multiverse intensifies
